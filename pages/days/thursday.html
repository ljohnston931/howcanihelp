                    <p>The Youth Detention Center program provides mentors for the youth at the Slate Canyon Youth Detention Center located in Provo, Utah. We currently provide reading tutoring, a book club, mentoring, sports recreation, and a bi-weekly life skills class to youth aged 13 to 18. Volunteers are role models and friends to the youth. Volunteers must be at least 21 years of age and receive a background check after their first visit. Come help inmates learn to read Tuesdays and Thursdays from 6-7 pm or play sports Saturday mornings. </p>
